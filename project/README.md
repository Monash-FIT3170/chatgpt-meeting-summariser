# ChatGPT Meeting Summariser
Meetings can go on for a long time with someone tasked with taking notes and
then distributing them after. The task of taking notes and summarising them can also be a
tedious one. Now we ask ChatGPT to be that someone! We will utilise the summarisation
skills of ChatGPT to practise brevity on tedious conversions and then notify everyone who
attended so that people do not miss out on important meeting points again.
